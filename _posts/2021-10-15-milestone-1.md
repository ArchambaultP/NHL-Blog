# Question 1: Warm-up

## 1
[
* which is the ratio of their shots saved over the total number of shots they faced
* What issues do you notice by using this metric to rank goalies?
* What could be done to deal with this?

]

## 2

[Filter out the goalies using your proposed approach above, and produce a bar plot with player names on the y-axis and save percentage (‘SV%’) on the x-axis]

## 3

[Discuss what other features could potentially be useful in determining a goalie’s performance]

# Question 2: Data Acquisition

[Write a brief tutorial on how your team downloaded the dataset.]

# Question 3: Interactive Debugging Tool

Here is a screenshot showing the tool for question 3.
It is built with 3 nested slider widgets to control which event is display.
A portion of the event JSON is displayed as well as its position on the rink.
One slider controls the dataset/season, another controls which game and the third controls which event from that game is displayed.

# Question 4: Tidy Data

## 1
[a small snippet of your final dataframe (e.g. using head(10)). You can just include a screenshot rather than fighting to get the tables neatly formatted in HTML/markdown.]

## 2
[Discuss how you could add the actual strength information (i.e. 5 on 4, etc.) to both shots and goals, given the other event types (beyond just shots and goals) and features available.]

## 3
[In a few sentences, discuss some additional features you could consider creating from the data available in this dataset.]

# Question 5: Simple Visualizations

## 1
[
* histogram of shot types over all teams in a season of your choosing.
* Overlay the number of goals overtop the number of shots.
* What appears to be the most dangerous type of shot?
* The most common type of shot?

]

## 2
[
* What is the relationship between the distance a shot was taken and the chance it was a goal?
* Produce a figure for each season between 2018-19 to 2020-21 to answer this
* a couple of sentences describing your figure
* Has there been much change over the past three seasons

]

## 3
[
* Combine the information from the previous sections to produce a figure that shows the goal percentage (# goals / # shots) as a function of both distance from the net, and the category of shot types (you can pick a single season of your choice)
* Briefly discuss your findings

]

# Question 6: Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps

## 1
[
* Export the plot to HTML, and embed it
* Your plot must allow users to select any season between 2016-17 and 2020-2021, as well as any team during the selected season.

]

## 2
[Discuss (in a few sentences) what you can interpret from these plots.]

## 3
[
* Discuss what you could say about the team during this season.
* Now look at the shot map for the Colorado Avalanche for the 2020-21 season, and discuss what you could conclude from these differences.
* Does this make sense?

]

## 4
[
* Discuss what observations you can make.
* Is there anything that could explain the Lightning’s success, or the Sabres’ struggles?
* How complete of a picture do you think this paints?

]
