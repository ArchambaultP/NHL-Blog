# Question 1: Warm-up

## 1

Right off the bat, by looking at the top-ranked goalies according to this metric, we notice that the 7 best goalies have
only played from 1 to 5 games and have only been shot at from 7 to 123 times.
On the other hand, the 10th best goalie according to this metric has played 47 games and has been shot at 1388 times.
As in any statistics, a small subset of a population is not representative of said
population.
It follows that the ranking for these top 7 goalies does not seem representative enough compared to this 10th goalie.
This is like ranking without considering the error bars of uncertainty.
To fix this, we could try to take this uncertainty into account by calculating those uncertainties and displaying them
as part of this ranking. This way, at least we are not leading people to the wrong conclusions.
Also, we notice that using the save percentage as the best metric to rank the best goalie isn't necessarily a good
assumption. Are we sure that the best goalie is ranked by this specific metric?
A better ranking system could be found by talking to some experts in order to choose the best metric.
This could be a new metric that is based on the save percentage in addition to other
metrics that they deem necessary to rank the best goalie.
For example, perhaps we also need to take into account if the goalie is left-handed or right-handed.
For the next topic, we propose a cut-off line for the goalies who have played at least half of the regular season games.

As we will see in the topics ahead, there are relationships between the type and distance of the shot and the probability of a goal. Thus, a good metric should weigh defenses for the most dangerous shots.

# Question 2: Data Acquisition

There are two important functions situated in the ift6758.data module that are used to download our dataset:

![image](/images/load_entire_dataset.png)
![image](/images/import_dataset.png)

The function `load_entire_dataset` lets us load the regular season and playoff data for every season since 2016, while `import_dataset` encapsulates our fetching behaviour for a given season and a type (regular/playoff). The `import_dataset` function works by looking for an existing dataset and returning it as a json object if it exists, otherwise it fetches all the games in a given season according to that season's schedule, saves the result in a json file, then returns the data as a json object. As such, our dataset is composed of two json files per season: one for the regular season and one for the playoffs.

To download the dataset, all we have to do is to execute the following in a notebook cell:

```
from ift6758.data import load_entire_dataset
load_entire_dataset()
```

This will download the dataset into the data module under the `dataset` directory, unless a path is given to `import_dataset` within the function definition.

Then to access a given season's data we simply need to call "import_dataset". For example, here is the code to load the raw json data for the 2016-2017 season:

```
from ift6758.data import import_dataset
2016_regular_json_data = import_dataset(2016, "R", returnData=True)
```

To have a dataframe of every season's data, one needs to extract (and tidy) every season as shown above, then store all the resulting data in a common dataframe.

To download the NHL dataset, we have opted to save every season in its own file to simplify things.

# Question 3: Interactive Debugging Tool


![image](/images/Interactive_debugging_tool_screenshot.PNG)

Here is a screenshot showing the tool for question 3.
It is built with 3 nested slider widgets to control which event is display.
A portion of the event JSON is displayed as well as its position on the rink.
One slider controls the dataset/season, another controls which game and the third controls which event from that game is displayed.

# Question 5: Simple Visualizations

## 5.1

Considering the shots of the 2016-2017 season, we have the distribution below in relation to the type of shot and the percentage of goals:
The most dangerous shot types are "deflected" and 'tip-in", although they are not the most common, given the circumstances in the game that they can be used. The most common type is the "wrist shot", with the "snap" shot" and the "slap shot" coming next.

## 5.2

In relation to the shot distance and the goal probability over the 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 times, a distribution considering ranges of 20 feet of distance to the goal line is presented. Then most likely range (up to 20 feet) was re-destructed in 2-feet steps. It can be seen that the probability over the years has not changed substantially.

## 5.3

To understand the percentage of goals (# goals / # shots) as a function of distance and type of shot, we chose the 2016 season, and as in the previous item, we distributed it in 20-foot scales and then detailed the first lane in steps of 2 feet. We have included a graph with the total number of shots in each category on the side, for better comparison. Some type/distance pair have a high probability, but with a limited number of examples. In general, shots up to 6 feet have high efficiency, with emphasis again on the "tip-in" and "deflected" types.

# Question 6: Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps

## 1

{% include shot-heatmap.html%}

## 2

The above heat map shows the difference in frequence between a team's shots and a league average for a given season. Data is shown only in the "offensive" zone where the middle of the rink is the y-axis, and the distance from the goal is the x-axis. 

The contour plot represents the difference in rate of shots per hour, where a denser region represents a more frequent shot location for a given team compared to that year's average. Conversly, a team that has shot less than the league's average that year will be represented by blue contours.

The contours have been smoothed to encompass a "better defined" region, thus for small differences in rates of shot we are presented with an either pale red or pale blue contour that are functionally equivalent to 0. However, for presentation purposes we decided to keep all the information available to us on the chart as we can hover over the figure to see the difference in rates of shot, shown as the "z" axis.

### Colorado Avalanche 2016-2017 shot map:

### Colorado Avalanche 2020-2021 shot map:
![image](/images/colorado2020.png)

We can see from the 2016 season shot map that the Colorado Avalanche really struggled to control the puck in the enemy's defensive zone. Notice that they shot mostly from the middle left area of the rink, and often shot from either behind the goal or in the back (close from the center) of the offensive zone. They also shot much less in front of the goal than that year's league average, which most likely hurt their standing that year since that's the most dangerous shot area.

The 2020-2021 season shot map tells a diffrent story: that year, the Avalanche seemed to shoot more often than that year's average all around the offensive zone. Mainly, they shot more often in front of the net, in the center of the offensive zone, and closer to the net from the sides.  This appears to show they had a much stronger offense that season. 

The results make sense considering the Avalanche was the last team in their division in the 2016-2017 season, whereas the Avalanche are the number one team in their division (and the league) for the 2020-2021 season. As we know, the stronger the offense, the more goals are scored, which increases the team's overall standing.

### Lightning 2020-2021 shot map:
![image](/images/lightning2020.png)

We can make two main observations from the above shotmaps: the Buffalo really seems to really struggle offensively, while the Lightning possess a very strong offense. 

Notice how most of the Buffalo's shots come from the sides of the offensive zone while very few are directly in front of the net. More shots than average also seem to come from behind the net, which most likely show that their offense had to get rid of the puck as they could not maneuver it within a good shot location. Overall the Buffalo's offense seem to be more scattered over the offensive zone and most shots are shot in less dangerous areas, resulting in less goals overall, which could explain the Buffalo's poor performance over the past few years.

Almost inversely, the Lightning's shot areas are mainly concentrated in front of the net and mostly in the center of the offensive zone. Interestingly, the Lightning's most frequent shot area (in front of the net) is slightly behind the usual "front of the net" area observed for the league's average. As this has been the case for 3 consecutive years, it seems like that area plays into their strategy. The Lightning shooting more often from the center zone could also explain the team's high standing; they probably have much more control over the puck in the offensive zone, and they can effectively shoot from more dangerous areas, yielding more goals.

Those heat maps are pretty useful, to reason about a team's offensive performance in terms of shot location and frequency. However, they do not tell the whole story. For instance, a seemingly frequent shot area for a team (e.g. in front of the net) compared to the average does not indicate an absolute increase in performance. The fact that certain zones are more "dangerous" than others plays part when assessing a team's performance but it does not tell us whether that area was definitvely the reason (or not) why a team did well or not. For instance, in the 2017-2018 season the Canadiens had an above average rate of shot right in front of the net, but the team still ended up being in the bottom of the standing. To get the full picture of a team's performance, we would need to aggregate more performance metrics and compare all of them between teams for a given season.
