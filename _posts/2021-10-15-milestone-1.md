# Question 1: Warm-up

## 1

Right off the bat, by looking at the top-ranked goalies according to this metric, we notice that the 7 best goalies have
only played from 1 to 5 games and have only been shot at from 7 to 123 times.
On the other hand, the 10th best goalie according to this metric has played 47 games and has been shot at 1388 times.
As in any statistics, a small subset of a population is not representative of said
population.
It follows that the ranking for these top 7 goalies does not seem representative enough compared to this 10th goalie.
This is like ranking without considering the error bars of uncertainty.
To fix this, we could try to take this uncertainty into account by calculating those uncertainties and displaying them
as part of this ranking. This way, at least we are not leading people to the wrong conclusions.
Also, we notice that using the save percentage as the best metric to rank the best goalie isn't necessarily a good
assumption. Are we sure that the best goalie is ranked by this specific metric?
A better ranking system could be found by talking to some experts in order to choose the best metric.
This could be a new metric that is based on the save percentage in addition to other
metrics that they deem necessary to rank the best goalie.
For example, perhaps we also need to take into account if the goalie is left-handed or right-handed.


## 2

[Filter out the goalies using your proposed approach above, and produce a bar plot with player names on the y-axis and save percentage (‘SV%’) on the x-axis]

## 3

[Discuss what other features could potentially be useful in determining a goalie’s performance]

# Question 2: Data Acquisition

[Write a brief tutorial on how your team downloaded the dataset.]

# Question 3: Interactive Debugging Tool


![image](../images/Interactive_debugging_tool_screenshot.PNG)

Here is a screenshot showing the tool for question 3.
It is built with 3 nested slider widgets to control which event is display.
A portion of the event JSON is displayed as well as its position on the rink.
One slider controls the dataset/season, another controls which game and the third controls which event from that game is displayed.

# Question 4: Tidy Data

## 1
[a small snippet of your final dataframe (e.g. using head(10)). You can just include a screenshot rather than fighting to get the tables neatly formatted in HTML/markdown.]

## 2
[Discuss how you could add the actual strength information (i.e. 5 on 4, etc.) to both shots and goals, given the other event types (beyond just shots and goals) and features available.]

## 3
[In a few sentences, discuss some additional features you could consider creating from the data available in this dataset.]

# Question 5: Simple Visualizations

## 1
[
* histogram of shot types over all teams in a season of your choosing.
* Overlay the number of goals overtop the number of shots.
* What appears to be the most dangerous type of shot?
* The most common type of shot?

]

## 2
[
* What is the relationship between the distance a shot was taken and the chance it was a goal?
* Produce a figure for each season between 2018-19 to 2020-21 to answer this
* a couple of sentences describing your figure
* Has there been much change over the past three seasons

]

## 3
[
* Combine the information from the previous sections to produce a figure that shows the goal percentage (# goals / # shots) as a function of both distance from the net, and the category of shot types (you can pick a single season of your choice)
* Briefly discuss your findings

]

# Question 6: Advanced Visualizations: Shot Maps

## 1
[
* Export the plot to HTML, and embed it
* Your plot must allow users to select any season between 2016-17 and 2020-2021, as well as any team during the selected season.

]

## 2
[Discuss (in a few sentences) what you can interpret from these plots.]

## 3
[
* Discuss what you could say about the team during this season.
* Now look at the shot map for the Colorado Avalanche for the 2020-21 season, and discuss what you could conclude from these differences.
* Does this make sense?

]

## 4
[
* Discuss what observations you can make.
* Is there anything that could explain the Lightning’s success, or the Sabres’ struggles?
* How complete of a picture do you think this paints?

]
