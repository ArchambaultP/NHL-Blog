# Question 2: Feature Engineering 1

## 1

The first feature to be plotted is distance:
![](../images/Shot%20Count%20per%20Distance.png)
As we can see, the amount of shots taken further than about 60 meters drops drastically.
This is probably the distance at which most player become comfortable making shots.
The number of no-goal shots seem to fluctuate with a minimum around 600 before this 60 meters mark.
However, the number of goals decreases in a non-linear way until almost 0 at this 60 meters mark.
This decrease almost looks like an exponential one.
From this drop alone, we can clearly identify distance as a good prediction feature.

The next feature to be plotted is angle:
![](../images/Shot%20Count%20per%20Angle.png)
We can see that the more the absolute value of the angle increases, the less goals there are.
However, for the number of non-goal shots, it isn't as straightforward.
It seems as though there are a lot of shots at zero angle.
But then, there is a sudden drop from about 4 degrees to 18 degrees followed by an increase from about 22 degrees to about 30 degrees.
This second local maxima seems odd. It would suggest that this angle is an angle that most players feel comfortable to shoot from.
In any case, this increase in shots doesn't come with a visible increase in goals.

Next, we can plot the shots as a function of both distance and angle.

This particular shape illustrates the physical limitations of the game.
As you go further from the net, there is less possible angles to choose from to shoot at the net.
Furthermore, it is possible that these angles don't extend to both sides of the rink as the further you are, the harder it is to aim correctly at the net from an angle.
This explains the reason why there is a higher shot rate at 0 degrees, it accounts for both close and far away shots.
From this cloud of points, we can also deduce that it will be hard for a simple logistic regression to clearly separate goals from no-goals.

## 2

The fist goal rates chart is plotted against distance:
![](../images/Goal%20Rates%20per%20Shot%20Distance.png)
As we can see, initially, the rate seems to decrease as distance increases.
But after the 60-75 meters mark, the rates become a bit less stable and increases.
By referring to the plot of shot count per distance, we conclude that the rates before the 60 meters have a higher confidence interval than those further back.
This is because there is a lot more data which means that these rates are a lot more representative.
Since after this mark there is little to no data, it explains why the rates suddenly aren't stable.
It is also possible that there are other factors or features at play that should be included to understand this distribution.

The second goal rate chart is plotted against shot angle.
![](../images/Goal%20Rates%20per%20Shot%20Angle.png)
Similarly to the goal counts per angle, the trend in shot rates seems to peak at zero degrees and slowly decreases as the angle increases.
This makes sense with the intuition that shooting in the net is easier from the front than from the sides.

## 3

In this histogram, we see that the number of goals with empty nets varies from zero to around 10 across all distances.
On the other hand, the number goals without empty nets peaks close to the net and then decreases as the distance gets further away.
Further than the 60 meters mark, we start to see more goals with empty nets than goals with non-empty nets.
This makes sense with the intuition that the further the shot is from the net, the easier it is for the goalie to block it.
However, if there is no goalie, the shots become a lot more feasible.
Furthermore, it makes sense with the fluctuation of goal rates seen in the histogram of goal rates per distance.
This feature is probably a good indicator of if a shot will succeed or not.

On another note, it seems like there are a number of goals at around 165 meters that are with a non-empty net.
This doesn't follow the trend and seems like either outlier data or noisy data.
It is possible that these shots have bad x/y coordinates which would explain why it doesn't follow the trend.
